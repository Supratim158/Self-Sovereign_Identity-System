## Project Title
*Self-Sovereign Identity System* — A decentralized platform for secure and private identity management on the blockchain.

---

## Project Description
The *Self-Sovereign Identity System* is a blockchain-based decentralized application (Dapp) designed to empower individuals with full control over their digital identities. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this platform allows users to create, manage, and store their identity data securely without relying on centralized authorities. By leveraging smart contracts, the system ensures that identity information is immutable, verifiable, and accessible only with user consent.

The Dapp provides a user-friendly React frontend that interacts seamlessly with the Ethereum blockchain via Ethers.js. Users can input personal details such as name, email, date of birth, and Aadhar number, which are encrypted using a user-provided encryption key for enhanced privacy. The system supports advanced features like identity history tracking, export/import of identities and encryption keys, and pagination for efficient history navigation. A robust validation mechanism ensures data integrity, while tooltips and wallet address display enhance the user experience.

This platform eliminates the risks associated with centralized identity providers, such as data breaches and unauthorized access, by storing encrypted identity records on-chain. Users can manage custom attributes, edit or delete identities, and export their data for backup or transfer. The system’s transparent and secure design fosters trust, making it ideal for applications requiring verifiable and private identity management.

## Project Vision
The *Self-Sovereign Identity System* aims to redefine digital identity management by placing control firmly in the hands of individuals. Our vision is to create a decentralized, privacy-first platform that eliminates dependency on third-party providers, reduces vulnerabilities, and promotes user autonomy. By harnessing blockchain technology, we strive to build a secure, transparent, and accessible identity solution that empowers users to share their data selectively and confidently.

We envision a world where individuals own their digital identities, free from centralized oversight, and can seamlessly interact with services like decentralized finance (DeFi), governance systems, and online platforms. Through continuous innovation, we aim to set a new standard for identity management that prioritizes security, usability, and inclusivity, enabling global adoption of self-sovereign identity principles.

## Future Scope
The *Self-Sovereign Identity System* lays a strong foundation for decentralized identity management, with several enhancements planned to expand its capabilities:

- *Verifiable Credentials Support*: Integrate W3C Verifiable Credentials to allow users to share attested identity claims with third parties securely.
- *Zero-Knowledge Proofs*: Implement advanced cryptographic techniques to enable selective disclosure of identity attributes without revealing sensitive data.
- *Multi-Chain Compatibility*: Extend support to other blockchains (e.g., Polygon, Solana) for lower transaction costs and broader accessibility.
- *Mobile App Development*: Create a mobile application for iOS and Android to facilitate identity management on the go.
- *Decentralized Storage Integration*: Use IPFS or Arweave to store encrypted identity metadata off-chain, improving scalability while maintaining security.
- *Identity Sharing and Access Control*: Develop mechanisms for users to grant and revoke access to their identity data for specific services or verifiers.
- *Analytics Dashboard*: Provide users with insights into their identity usage, transaction history, and verification requests.

## Key Features
The *Self-Sovereign Identity System* offers a robust set of features to ensure secure, user-controlled identity management:

- *Decentralized Identity Creation*: Users can create self-sovereign identities with personal details (name, email, date of birth, Aadhar number) stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
- *Data Encryption*: Aadhar numbers are encrypted with a user-provided key, ensuring privacy and security of sensitive information.
- *Wallet Integration*: Displays the connected MetaMask wallet address, enhancing transparency and user trust.
- *Form Validation and Tooltips*: Validates inputs (e.g., Aadhar number, email format) in real-time and provides tooltips with guidance for accurate data entry.
- *Identity History Management*: Tracks all created identities with search functionality, edit/delete options, and pagination (5 items per page) for efficient navigation.
- *Export/Import Identities*: Allows users to export identity history to a JSON file and import it back, facilitating backups and data portability.
- *Export/Import Encryption Key*: Enables users to export their encryption key to a JSON file and import it to restore access to encrypted data.
- *Immutable Records*: Identity data is stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof and verifiable records.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: A responsive React frontend with a modern design, featuring gradient backgrounds, intuitive controls, and mobile compatibility.
- *Smart Contract Security*: Solidity-based contract with safe interactions, integrated via Ethers.js for reliable blockchain communication.
