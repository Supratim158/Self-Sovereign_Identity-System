## Project Title
Self-Sovereign Identity System

## Project Description
Create a decentralized identity platform where users control their own identity without relying on any centralized authority. The system uses blockchain technology to secure and verify identity information, allowing users full ownership and privacy.

## Project Vision
To empower individuals by providing a secure, decentralized digital identity solution that eliminates dependency on third-party providers and enhances privacy and control over personal data.

## Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and services.
- Support for verifiable credentials and trusted attestations.
- Mobile app integration for easier identity management.
- Multi-chain support beyond Ethereum.
- Enhanced privacy features using zero-knowledge proofs.
- Decentralized reputation systems tied to identity.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Identity Ownership**: Users create and manage their identity on the blockchain.
- **Immutable Identity Records**: Identity data stored securely and transparently on the smart contract.
- **User-Controlled Access**: Users decide who can view or verify their identity details.
- **Blockchain-Based Verification**: Trusted, tamper-proof verification of identity credentials.
- **React Frontend**: Easy-to-use UI for interacting with the smart contract.
- **Ethers.js Integration**: Secure connection and transactions between frontend and blockchain.
- **Smart Contract Security**: Solidity-based contract with safe and upgradeable patterns.

### How to Run

1. **Deploy the Smart Contract:**

   - Use Hardhat or Remix to compile and deploy the contract.
   - Copy the deployed contract address.

2. **Configure Frontend:**

   - Paste the contract address and ABI into the frontend utils files.
   - Install dependencies with `npm install` in the frontend directory.
   - Run the frontend with `npm start`.

3. **Interact with the system via the React UI.**
