# Self-Sovereign Identity System

## 📌 Project Title
**Self-Sovereign Identity System**

## 📄 Project Description
Create a decentralized identity platform where users control their own identity. This smart contract stores basic identity details like name, email, and metadata (such as IPFS hash or encrypted identity blob) under the control of the user.

## 👁️ Project Vision
To empower individuals by giving them complete ownership and control over their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities. This project envisions a world where users are the sole custodians of their identity, accessible securely and transparently on a blockchain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with DID (Decentralized Identifiers) standards.
- Use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for private credential verification.
- Integration with decentralized storage (IPFS/Filecoin).
- Mobile wallet support with QR-code scanning for identity sharing.
- Role-based verifiers and multi-party attestations.

## ✨ Key Features
- ✅ User-owned identity creation and updates.
- ✅ On-chain storage of metadata for decentralized identity proofs.
- ✅ Simple verification mechanism for identity attestations.
- ✅ Fully open and accessible via public functions.
- ✅ Designed for modularity and future extensibility.
